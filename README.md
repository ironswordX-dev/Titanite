# Titanite -- a helper extension for the Skiovox exploit

**Some big and minor changes to the original, and some QoL improvements**

Once installed, open a new tab to see the extension's homepage.

This extension:

- Fixes most shortcut functionality within the exploit
- Allows for resizing and dragging of windows
- Makes it easier to add Google accounts and use the Web Store within the exploit
- Fixes functionality of some Google logins on webpages

*Note: You can exit fullscreen videos by pressing ctrl+T after you've set up the shortcuts*
